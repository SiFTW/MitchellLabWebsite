Simon’s primary research focus is in understanding how intracellular, molecular signalling networks control immune cell fate, and how misregulation of these molecular networks lead to haematological malignancies. His combination of immunology and haematological training lead to a particular interest in B-cell lymphomas. 

Simon combines data across temporal and spatial scales into computational simulations to explore how molecular events (taking <1 second at the nanometre scale) propagate through signalling dynamics and cell-population responses to contribute to whole-body outcomes (taking >1 month at scales of > 1 meter).

Simon has particular interest in the regulation of transcription factor NF-κB and its contribution to cell fate decisions in cancer, immunity and inflammation. His long-term ambition is to develop simulations capable of being parameterized from patient-specific data to be used in the clinic for personalized therapeutic guidance.

He also contributes computational systems biology approaches to many productive collaborations from neuroscience to iron regulation and is always looking for new collaborations where exciting biological questions require novel analytical approaches.
