Hi! I am Ankur Ghodke. I did my Bachelor of Technology in Bioengineering from MIT ADT University, India and currently doing my MSc in Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Biology at University of Sussex. I am trained in both wet lab experimentation and bioinformatics as well. I am currently working on developing a systems biology approach to understanding NFÎºB signalling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using computational modelling and flowcytometry. I look forward to learn and excel my skill while working on my MSc thesis here at Mitchell Lab with Simon and team.
