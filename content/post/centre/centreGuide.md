# Chapter 1. Laying the foundation

## Why start a research centre as an FLF?

You may be considering starting a centre, or perhaps your head of school has tasked you with starting one. Forming and/or directing a research centre is a lot of work, might distract from your research focus, and isn’t like to be in your job description. so the obvious question is... why bother?

### Why? Increase the impact of your FLF

As a Future Leaders Fellow you have designed a project that will have real world impact and shape the field(s) you’re in. You are likely to be pushing the existing boudaries of institutions, departments, schools and other structures that exist within and around your host institution. Founding and directing a research centre enables you to overcome institutional barriers and bring together people to enable the change you’re trying to make. 

### Why? Improve the research environment for yourself and others.

As your FLF progresses you are likely increasingly aware of the strengths and weaknesses of your host institution’s strucutre and strategy. In my first year the rose-colour glasses were still very much in place, but as time progresses you can realise

As a Future Leader’s Fellow you are on a rapid trajectory towards leadership in your institution, and leadership in the international research and innovation communities you belong to. You are also, by definition, building brides across multiple disciplines and research groupings. 

### Why? Enhance your career developmeent

It is common when applying for promotion to professor to be given the role of leading a research centre or grouping along with your promotion. 

This inevitably brings with it leadership roles in your institutions.

### Why? Support the career of others

## Is a centre needed? Identifying the unmet need.

### What exists and has existed?

### Identifying the natural leaders and discovering where you fit.

## Can you do it? 

### Do you have capacity and support.

### Identify allies and advocates.

## So, are you going to do this? Making the go/no go decision.
