# Chapter 0. Introduction

This guide will provide practical advice on launching and leading a research centre, with a specific focus on the challenges and opportunities presented to a Future Leaders Fellow. The guide is likely applicable to any researcher on a rapid trajectory towards leadership, but FLFs are likely to encounter these challenges earlier, and across disciplines in a way that can present unique challenges.

The guide is best viewed here, but can also be downloaded as a complete PDF above.

It is written from the perspective of an FLF.

# Chapter 1. Laying the foundation

## Why start a research centre as an FLF?

You may be considering starting a centre, or perhaps your head of school has tasked you with starting one. Forming and/or directing a research centre is a lot of work, might distract from your research focus, and isn’t like to be in your job description. So the obvious question is... why bother?

### Why? Increase the impact of your FLF

As a Future Leaders Fellow you have designed a project that will have real world impact and shape the field(s) you’re in. You are likely to be pushing the existing boudaries of institutions, departments, schools and other structures that exist within and around your host institution. Founding and directing a research centre enables you to overcome institutional barriers and bring together people to enable the change you’re trying to make. 

### Why? Improve the research environment for yourself and others.

As your FLF progresses you are likely increasingly aware of the strengths and weaknesses of your host institution’s structure and strategy. In my first year the rose-colour glasses were still very much in place, but as time progresses you can realise

As a Future Leader’s Fellow, you are on a rapid trajectory towards leadership in your institution, and leadership in the international research and innovation communities you belong to. You are also, by definition, building bridges across multiple disciplines and research groupings. 

### Why? Enhance your career development

It is common when applying for promotion to professor to be given the role of leading a research centre or grouping along with your promotion. This can often be decided *for you* based on institutional needs as seen by head of school. So, why not take the initiative, identify a leadership role you are passionate about, that aligns with your research goals, and take on centre leadership. Leading a research centre will be a strong plus point in your promotion application.

### Why? Support the career of others

It may be 

## Is a centre needed? Identifying the unmet need.

### What exists and has existed?

### Identifying the natural leaders and discovering where you fit.

## Can you do it? 

### Do you have capacity and support.

### Identify allies and advocates.

## So, are you going to do this? Making the go/no go decision.
