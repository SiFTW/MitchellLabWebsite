# Chapter 0. Introduction

This guide will provide practical advice on launching and leading a research centre, with a specific focus on the challenges and opportunities presented to a Future Leaders Fellow. The guide is likely applicable to any researcher on a rapid trajectory towards leadership, but FLFs are likely to encounter these challenges earlier, and across disciplines in a way that can present unique challenges.

## About the author
It is written from the perspective of an FLF. I recently launched a research centre, in the third year of my Future Leaders Fellowship. By most metrics [this](http://www.SussexCancer.org/launch) [went]( https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/24445605.new-sussex-cancer-research-centre-opens-county/) [well]( https://thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/technology-innovation/sussex-cancer-research-centre-launches-to-connect-regions-top-experts/). *But*, I encountered many challenges on the way, many of which were specific to being an FLF attempting to launch a centre. My rapid career timeline, my interdisciplinary research knowledge (and the knowledge gaps that come along with that), all contributed to challenges I needed to overcome. *Therefore*, I wrote this guide to hopefully ease the journey for others.

I would love to help as many FLFs as possible start research centres.

# Chapter 1. Surveying the landscape. 

The first step is figuring out whether a centre is needed at all, and whether you need to be involved in it. This sounds trivial, but you will need to answer this question many times, to many people, on the route to leading a centre.

By the end of this section you will know how to answer the questions:

- [ ] Why are you starting a centre?
- [ ] Why are you the right person to lead it?
- [ ] Hasn’t this been tried before?


## Why start a research centre as an FLF?

You may be considering starting a centre, or perhaps your head of school has tasked you with starting one. Forming and/or directing a research centre is a lot of work, might distract from your research focus, and isn’t like to be in your job description. So the obvious question is... why bother?

### Why? Increase the impact of your FLF

As a Future Leaders Fellow you have designed a project that will have real world impact and shape the field(s) you’re in. You are likely to be pushing the existing boudaries of institutions, departments, schools and other structures that exist within and around your host institution. Founding and directing a research centre enables you to overcome institutional barriers and bring together people to enable the change you’re trying to make. 

### Why? Improve the research environment for yourself and others.

As your FLF progresses you are likely increasingly aware of the strengths and weaknesses of your host institution’s structure and strategy. In my first year the rose-colour glasses were still very much in place, but as time progresses you can realise

As a Future Leader’s Fellow, you are on a rapid trajectory towards leadership in your institution, and leadership in the international research and innovation communities you belong to. You are also, by definition, building bridges across multiple disciplines and research groupings. 

### Why? Enhance your career development

It is common when applying for promotion to professor to be given the role of leading a research centre or grouping along with your promotion. This can often be decided *for you* based on institutional needs as seen by head of school. So, why not take the initiative, identify a leadership role you are passionate about, that aligns with your research goals, and take on centre leadership. Leading a research centre will be a strong plus point in your promotion application.

### Why? Support the career of others

When starting are centre many supporting roles are created. The development of your team is a key goal of the FLF. The ability to create roles such as “Early Career Research lead”, “Patient Engagement Lead”, “Outreach Lead” enables you to assign supportive roles to members of your FLF team. These can be tailored to match the skills and career development needs of individual members of your team. As a leader of a centre you are uniquely positioned to match people with roles within your centre.

If you’re still wondering whether you should start a research centre, perhaps it’s not the right time. Wait a year and reassess. Don’t force it, because it’s going to be *hard* work!

## Is a centre needed? Identifying the unmet need.

This is a big one. At many points in this process you will need and answer for people who ask “Why do we need a centre?” If you struggle when thinking about the answer to this for yourself then you will struggle to get the centre off the ground. Spend lots of time thinking about this, because you answer to this question will form the basis of many conversations, presentations, documents, and pitches to leadership as you progress.

In establishing the Sussex Cancer Research Centre I had two or three main themes:

-	Lack of visibility for our cancer research.
-	Missed opportunities for collaboration caused by institutional, geographic, and bureaucratic barriers.
-	An unmet need in cancer patients who were not benefitting from our research.

I was able to evidence each of these if asked, for example, with respect to the “Lack of visibility for our cancer research”:

-	*There was incredible research already happening.* This could be easily evidenced with grants, papers, and real world impact. Nobody I talked to disagreed with this, and I imagine no one will disagree with you if you tell them they’re doing amazing work.
-	*The outside world doesn’t see this.* I had a screenshot from Google of the search results for “Cancer Research Sussex”. It didn’t look like we’d spoken to each other since 2015!

### What exists and has existed?

You need to get a good sense of landscape and history around what you are trying to do.
For example, in my situation there had been a very similar attempt, about 10 years ago, which started with a lot of motivation but soon fell into abeyance and stopped meeting. While as an FLF it’s unlikely you will have been at your host institution long enough to know the full history it is worth seeking out people who have been there for a decade plus and asking them if anything like what you are trying to achieve has been tried before. If it has, it’s not a problem, but you need to know because senior people who need to decide whether to support you or not *will* remember previous attempts and may not have the appetite to try again unless you can clearly state why the result will be different this time. 

### Identifying the natural leaders and discovering where you fit.

People in your institution will have a sense of who should lead a new research centre. As an FLF, this may well not be you! The speed of your progression to leadership is likely greater than average and as such there will be people in your institution thinking: “Who are they?”.

Think about the more senior people in your institution that might want to head up your centre. You should meet those people. When I had such meetings I was frequently told:

> We need a new centre in this area but I don’t have time to do it.

And occasionally:

> I tried to do something like this in the past but wasn’t successful.

These are great responses, because they give you answers to the people you will encounter who say “Who are they? Why isn’t XXXXXXX leading the centre?”



## Can you do it? 

### Do you have capacity and support.

### Identify allies and advocates.

## So, are you going to do this? Making the go/no go decision.
