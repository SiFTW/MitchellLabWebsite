As a Research Fellow in Laboratory and Computational Systems Biology Cancer Research you will lead the delivery of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research project that combines computational systems biology and laboratory science to better treat cancers. 

This role builds on breakthrough results showing that computational models can predict how lymphoma patients respond to therapy, and expands these approaches to multiple cancers. This project will also focus on experimentally developing biomarkers that will enable systems biology models to predict response to therapy in the clinic. You will lead the delivery of this 3-year Future Leaders Fellowship-funded project, produce high quality academic publications, and share your work nationally and internationally at academic conferences. The flexible nature of the funding enables you to shape the project direction, and pursue the most promising results.

You will also benefit from substantial mentorship, training opportunities, and exposure to a variety of experimental and computational techniques that will contribute to your own development towards research and innovation leadership.
