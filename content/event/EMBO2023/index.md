Richard has been awarded a travel grant to attend [ EMBO Workshop Computational models of life: From molecular biology to digital twins](https://meetings.embo.org/event/23-comp-models-life).

[Richard](../../authors/richard) will share his latest findings demonstrating that simulating individual DLBCL patients can predict prognosis, beyond what is possible when patients are clustered by muations alone. Congratulations to Richard and enjoy Spain!
