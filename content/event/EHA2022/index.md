[Eleanor](../../author/eleanor-jayawant/) will present her project titled "FLOW CYTOMETRY COMBINED WITH SYSTEMS BIOLOGY ENABLES RATIONAL TARGETING OF NFKB IN DLBCL". This work represents her first year of progress on the project: [Therapeutic targeting of refractory relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through systems biology](../../project/rr-dlbcl/), funded by our [UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship](https://www.bsms.ac.uk/about/news/2020/10-15-bsms-researcher-receives-prestigious-fellowship.aspx). She has developed an exciting Flow Cytommetry pipeline to assess NFÎºB with unprecedented detail in DLBCL cells. The pipline informs computational modelling work to enable predictions of which cells will respond to targetted therapies. The work is part of an exciting collaboration with [Andrea and Chris Pepper](https://www.pepper.science/). The abstract code for this work is: P1266.

[Simon](../../author/simon-mitchell/) will present a project lead by [Ielyaas](../../author/ielyaas-cloete/), as part of a new collaboration with [Victoria Smith, Ross Jackson and Martin Dyer](https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/cancer/people/prof-martin-dyer), and [Andrea and Chris Pepper](https://www.pepper.science/). In this project, titled: "PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF DLBCL CELLS TO BH3-MIMETICS USING SYSTEMS BIOLOGY", we have created a new computational systems biology model of apoptosis that accurately predicts how DLBCL cells will respond to BH3-Mimetics. The model is validated by extensive experimental data and accurately predicts which cells respond to which drugs. This work is part of a [A Systems Biology Approach to Tailoring Therapy for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma](../../project/primary-dlbcl/") funded by [Leuakaemi UK](https://www.leukaemiauk.org.uk/lymphoma-using-virtual-patients-to-find-new-ways-to-treat-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma) and Simon is funded by a [UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship](../../project/rr-dlbcl/). The abstract code for this work is : P1252.

Both posters will be presented at the poster session on Friday, June 10 202 - 16:30 - 17:45 CEST.
