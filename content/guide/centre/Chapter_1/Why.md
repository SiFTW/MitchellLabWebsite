summary: As an FLF you are busy, and likely establishing yourself in new fields. So, why add launching a research/innovation centre to your overflowing todo list?

Before asking why a centre is needed, it's worth asking why *you* might want to start a centre. Why not leave it to someone else? Why not spend your time and energy elsewhere? You may be considering starting a centre, or perhaps your head of school has tasked you with starting one. Forming and/or directing a research centre is a lot of work, might distract from your research focus, and isn’t likely to be in your job description. So the obvious question is... why bother?

## Improve the research environment for yourself and others.

As your FLF progresses you are likely increasingly aware of the strengths and weaknesses of your host institution’s structure and strategy. In the first year of my FLF the rose-colour glasses were still very much in place, and the Unviersity felt like a well-oiled machine where everything had been figured out by people with more knowledge and experience than me. But as time progresses you may start to see room for improvement. 

As a Future Leader’s Fellow, you are on a rapid trajectory towards leadership in your institution, and leadership in the international research and innovation communities you belong to. You are also, by definition, building bridges across multiple disciplines and research groupings. You are probably discovering how siloed universities can be. How people that you know *should* be talking to each other are not. You might be realising that department strucutres, geographic separation across campuses, or administrative hurdles are barriers to cross-discipline working. As an interdisciplinary researcher you might be more aware of this than others in your institution.

A centre can be a vehicle to overcome these bariers to make your institution a better place for you to deliver your research agenda, but also a better place for your team and your colleauges to do their research.

## Increase the impact of your FLF

As a Future Leaders Fellow you have designed a project that will have real world impact and shape the field(s) you’re in. You are likely to be pushing the existing boudaries of institutions, departments, schools and other structures that exist within and around your host institution. Founding and directing a research centre enables you to overcome institutional barriers and bring together people to enable the change you’re trying to make. You probably proposed to bring people together across disciplines. Uniting these people in a new research centre is a concrete way to make that happen.

## Enhance your career development

It is common when applying for promotion to professor to be given the role of leading a research centre or grouping along with your promotion. This can often be decided *for you* based on institutional needs as seen by head of school. So, why not take the initiative, identify a leadership role you are passionate about, that aligns with your research goals, and take on centre leadership. Leading a research centre will be a strong plus point in your promotion application.

### Is this too selfish?

People will doubt your motives in running a centre. They will assume this is the only reason you're doing it: to secure the next promotion. Firstly, that is no bad thing. If you want to bring to fruition your groundbreaking research agenda, which you were funded to do, you need to be a leader, with responsibilities, and you probably need to be promoted! Your promotion is the promotion of your research agenda and all the impacts you were funded to deliver. You are an FLF because you have a plan and the skills to make a difference in the world, don't be shy that you need to be promoted to do that. 

## Support the career of others

When starting are centre many supporting roles are created. The development of your team is a key goal of the FLF. The ability to create roles such as “Early Career Research lead”, “Patient Engagement Lead”, “Outreach Lead” enables you to assign supportive roles to members of your FLF team. These can be tailored to match the skills and career development needs of individual members of your team. As a leader of a centre you are uniquely positioned to match people with roles within your centre.

## Still doubts?

If you’re still wondering whether you should start a research centre, perhaps it’s not the right time. Wait a year and reassess. Don’t feel like it's something you have to do, because it’s going to be *hard* work. If you're not convinced of the above motivations, and more than a little stubborn that this change needs to happen, you will not overcome the challenges ahead.
