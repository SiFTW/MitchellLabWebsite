You may be considering starting a centre, or perhaps your head of school has tasked you with starting one. Forming and/or directing a research centre is a lot of work, might distract from your research focus, and isn’t like to be in your job description. So the obvious question is... why bother?

## Why? Increase the impact of your FLF

As a Future Leaders Fellow you have designed a project that will have real world impact and shape the field(s) you’re in. You are likely to be pushing the existing boudaries of institutions, departments, schools and other structures that exist within and around your host institution. Founding and directing a research centre enables you to overcome institutional barriers and bring together people to enable the change you’re trying to make. 

### Why? Improve the research environment for yourself and others.

As your FLF progresses you are likely increasingly aware of the strengths and weaknesses of your host institution’s structure and strategy. In my first year the rose-colour glasses were still very much in place, but as time progresses you can realise

As a Future Leader’s Fellow, you are on a rapid trajectory towards leadership in your institution, and leadership in the international research and innovation communities you belong to. You are also, by definition, building bridges across multiple disciplines and research groupings. 

### Why? Enhance your career development

It is common when applying for promotion to professor to be given the role of leading a research centre or grouping along with your promotion. This can often be decided *for you* based on institutional needs as seen by head of school. So, why not take the initiative, identify a leadership role you are passionate about, that aligns with your research goals, and take on centre leadership. Leading a research centre will be a strong plus point in your promotion application.

### Why? Support the career of others

When starting are centre many supporting roles are created. The development of your team is a key goal of the FLF. The ability to create roles such as “Early Career Research lead”, “Patient Engagement Lead”, “Outreach Lead” enables you to assign supportive roles to members of your FLF team. These can be tailored to match the skills and career development needs of individual members of your team. As a leader of a centre you are uniquely positioned to match people with roles within your centre.

If you’re still wondering whether you should start a research centre, perhaps it’s not the right time. Wait a year and reassess. Don’t force it, because it’s going to be *hard* work!
