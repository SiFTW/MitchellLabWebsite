## Is a centre needed? Identifying the unmet need.

This is a big one. At many points in this process you will need and answer for people who ask “Why do we need a centre?” If you struggle when thinking about the answer to this for yourself then you will struggle to get the centre off the ground. Spend lots of time thinking about this, because you answer to this question will form the basis of many conversations, presentations, documents, and pitches to leadership as you progress.

In establishing the Sussex Cancer Research Centre I had two or three main themes:

-	Lack of visibility for our cancer research.
-	Missed opportunities for collaboration caused by institutional, geographic, and bureaucratic barriers.
-	An unmet need in cancer patients who were not benefitting from our research.

I was able to evidence each of these if asked, for example, with respect to the “Lack of visibility for our cancer research”:

-	*There was incredible research already happening.* This could be easily evidenced with grants, papers, and real world impact. Nobody I talked to disagreed with this, and I imagine no one will disagree with you if you tell them they’re doing amazing work.
-	*The outside world doesn’t see this.* I had a screenshot from Google of the search results for “Cancer Research Sussex”. It didn’t look like we’d spoken to each other since 2015!

### What exists and has existed?

You need to get a good sense of landscape and history around what you are trying to do.
For example, in my situation there had been a very similar attempt, about 10 years ago, which started with a lot of motivation but soon fell into abeyance and stopped meeting. While as an FLF it’s unlikely you will have been at your host institution long enough to know the full history it is worth seeking out people who have been there for a decade plus and asking them if anything like what you are trying to achieve has been tried before. If it has, it’s not a problem, but you need to know because senior people who need to decide whether to support you or not *will* remember previous attempts and may not have the appetite to try again unless you can clearly state why the result will be different this time. 

### Identifying the natural leaders and discovering where you fit.

People in your institution will have a sense of who should lead a new research centre. As an FLF, this may well not be you! The speed of your progression to leadership is likely greater than average and as such there will be people in your institution thinking: “Who are they?”.

Think about the more senior people in your institution that might want to head up your centre. You should meet those people. When I had such meetings I was frequently told:

> We need a new centre in this area but I don’t have time to do it.

And occasionally:

> I tried to do something like this in the past but wasn’t successful.

These are great responses, because they give you answers to the people you will encounter who say “Who are they? Why isn’t XXXXXXX leading the centre?”
