summary: Figuring out whether you're the right person, to start a research centre, and why now.
---

The three big questions this entire guide is answering are:

- Why?
  - Why is a centre needed?
- What?
  - What will the centre look like?
- How?
  - How will the centre work and address the challenge?
 
THis chapter focuses on *"Why?"*. There are actually three big questions within *"why?"*:

- Why is a centre needed *at all*?
- Why is a centre needed *now*?
- Why is a centre needed *run by you*?

THis section chapter addresses these questions. The first step is figuring out whether a centre is needed at all, and whether you need to be involved in it. This sounds trivial, but you will need to answer this question many times, to many people, on the route to leading a centre.

By the end of this section you will know how to answer the questions:

- [ ] Why are you starting a centre?
- [ ] Why are you the right person to lead it?
- [ ] Has this been tried before and what's different now?
- [ ] Who are my key supporters?
- [ ] Am I really going to do this?
