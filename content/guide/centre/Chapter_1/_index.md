summary: Figuring out whether you're the right person, to start a research centre, and why now.
---


The first step is figuring out whether a centre is needed at all, and whether you need to be involved in it. This sounds trivial, but you will need to answer this question many times, to many people, on the route to leading a centre.

By the end of this section you will know how to answer the questions:

- [ ] Why are you starting a centre?
- [ ] Why are you the right person to lead it?
- [ ] Hasnâ€™t this been tried before?
- [ ] Who are my key supporters?
- [ ] Am I really going to do this?
