## Can you do it? 


### Identifying the natural leaders and discovering where you fit.

People in your institution will have a sense of who should lead a new research centre. As an FLF, this may well not be you! The speed of your progression to leadership is likely greater than average and as such there will be people in your institution thinking: “Who are they?”.

Think about the more senior people in your institution that might want to head up your centre. You should meet those people. When I had such meetings I was frequently told:

> We need a new centre in this area but I don’t have time to do it.

And occasionally:

> I tried to do something like this in the past but wasn’t successful.

These are great responses, because they give you answers to the people you will encounter who say “Who are they? Why isn’t XXXXXXX leading the centre?”

### Do you have capacity and support.


## Identify allies and advocates.
