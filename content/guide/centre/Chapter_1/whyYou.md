## Can you do it? 

### Identifying the natural leaders and discovering where you fit.

People in your institution will have a sense of who should lead a new research centre. As an FLF, this may well not be you! It may be that the institution has been lining up somebody to lead a similar endeavour for years and you need to find these people and figure this out.

Think about the more senior people in your institution that might want to head up your centre. You should meet those people. When I had such meetings I was frequently told:

> We need a new centre in this area but I don’t have time to do it.

And occasionally:

> I tried to do something like this in the past but wasn’t successful.

These are great responses, because they give you answers to the people you will encounter who say “Who are they? Why isn’t XXXXXXX leading the centre?”

### Am I not too junior?

If you're reading this, you're likely an FLF, who has been at your institution for 1-7 years. When most people imagine a centre founder/director they imagine someone who has been there for 10+ years and climbed the ranks slowly over time. The speed of your progression to leadership is likely greater than average, and as such there will be people in your institution thinking: “Who are they?”.

The first thing to say, at least to yourself, is that you are Future Leaders Fellow. This means a rigorous peer reviewed process has agreed that you have the potential to be an international research leader.  


### Do you have capacity and support.


## Identify allies and advocates.
