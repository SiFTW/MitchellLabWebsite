## 2.1 Look out for presentation opportunities

In order to identify any critical objections early, be on the lookout for meetings of key stakeholders and be ready to present an outline of your vision for a centre. At this stage it’s not a good idea to set up a special meeting, or invite people yourself, as the vision for the centre has not had input from key stakeholders. If you pitch your ideas too publicly before seeking everyone’s input many will not feel included. However, if you see an opportunity to float your vision for a new centre in the agenda of an appropriate meeting, then take it. Bonus points if the meeting includes some people who stand to benefit from the establishment of a centre. Remember, when reaching out to be added to the meeting agenda, that you have nothing more than an idea and want to informally gauge interest.

For the Sussex Cancer Research Centre, I knew clinical cancer researchers, nurses and allied health professionals had not been involved in previous attempts to unite researchers. Therefore, when a meeting of clinical cancer researchers appeared on my radar, I asked the oncologist running the meeting whether he would mind me presenting for 5 minutes. The presentation outline reflected the outline responses we developed in Chapter 1. Why do we need a centre? Who would be involved? Hasn’t this been tried before? What is different this time? and what might its identity be? The presentation finished with opening the floor with questions such as “Should we do this?”, “Am I missing anyone/anything?”. Having received positive feedback from this group I knew when moving forwards with a vision document I could claim to have support of hospital-based cancer researchers which would differentiate us from previous attempts to unite people within a research centre for cancer research.

## 2.2 Creating a vision document

In Chapter 1 we established that you want to set up and lead a new research centre. You identified why, and you’ve identified some key support to help you get there. Now it is time to document some of these ideas and describe what your centre will look like. You need a vision document. The goal of this vision document it to have a single document to send to all key stakeholders. This single PDF will tell stakeholders everything they need to know about why a centre is necessary, what the centre you’re establishing will look like, and what it will achieve.

Starting with a blank document and describing a new research centre from scratch may seem daunting. However, the pages will quickly fill up once you start capturing all of the ideas from chapter 1. The real challenge is editing down the document into a concise and digestible format. Anything more than 5-6 pages risks not being read by anyone. To make the task easier I’ve attached an outline version of the vision document, which my co-directors and I constructed for the Sussex Cancer Research Centre (below). This document contains a potential layout, headings, and writing prompts for a vision document for your centre. 

The vision document will be the first impression of your endeavour for everyone that is important to your centre’s success. We found the best process for writing this vision document was very reminiscent of the process of grant writing. We first put all our ideas down into the headings provided in the draft guide, without respect for space limits. Then, we embarked on the challenging process of refining each paragraph, sentence and word to fit in space constraints we set ourselves. You will need to iterate on this entire process a couple of times with the 2-3 critical friends/co-directors you identified in Chapter 1. Your first draft will not fully capture your vision and it is important to get this document right. You should allow at least a few weeks for this writing and iterating process.

The vision document will also benefit from investing some time and thought into centre branding. While image is less important than content at this stage, an appropriate name, slogan, logo, and colour scheme can contribute to achieving buy-in for your vision. 
You likely don’t have a budget for anyone to help with this but think about what makes your centre unique and try and incorporate that into a logo and slogan. For the Sussex Cancer Research Centre we knew that patients had been left behind in previous attempts to unite cancer researchers and so we placed a patient icon at the centre of the logo, with a slogan of “putting patients at the centre of cancer research”.

Once you have a first draft, that has been revised a couple of time by your critical friends you’re ready to use this document as the basis for soliciting buy-in for your vision.
