You need a newsletter. You won’t be able to do everything at once, so the ability to tell everyone when things happen is going to be important. You want to be able to advertise: the funding calls opening and closing, engagement events for various stakeholders, new initiatives you launch, and of course shout about the successes the centre has made possible. You can do this by creating a simple mailing list, your institution likely has ways to do this. I have also found the service [“Curated”](https://www.curated.co/) lets me run professional mailing lists easily. It’s free below 1,500 subscribers.
