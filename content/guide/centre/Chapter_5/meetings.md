You’ve brought people together within your centre. Now it’s time to arrange some meetings for subgroups of those people to start to work together. Consider using the interactive sessions at your launch or the registration form for the launch, as a way to collect people’s research interests and arrange meetings around those themes. Advertise these meetings in your newsletter. Try and steer these meetings towards identifying funding opportunities for these new collaborations as your institution will want to see the fruits of your labour.
