I am a Future Leaders Fellow (FLF) and recently took on the challenge of creating, launching and leading a new centre: The Sussex Cancer Research Centre. I launched the centre in July 2024 when in my third year as an FLF and the centre is now a reality. By most metrics [this](http://www.SussexCancer.org/launch), [was]( https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/24445605.new-sussex-cancer-research-centre-opens-county/), [successful]( https://thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/technology-innovation/sussex-cancer-research-centre-launches-to-connect-regions-top-experts/), and for me personally the whole experience has proved immensely rewarding.

My goal in producing this guide is to share my experience with the aim of helping as many FLFs as possible to start research (or innovation) centres of their own. I have written the guide from my perspective, drawing on the opportunities, frustrations and rewards I encountered throughout the process. I aim to provide practical advice for others intending to take on a similar challenge as they strive for a successful outcome. Through this guide I hope to ease the journey for others by passing on the things that worked, and highlighting the pitfalls I wish I had avoided along the way. 

I give special focus to my experience as an FLF with the understanding that FLFs can find themselves in situations that are uniquely challenging, most notably by being early in their careers, needing to establish credibility and often needing to work across disciplines. My career trajectory as an FLF, the interdisciplinary nature of my research, and the knowledge gaps that inevitably come with that, all contributed to challenges I had to overcome. While I believe many of the difficulties I encountered were specific to being an FLF, this guide is likely applicable to any researcher on a rapid trajectory towards leadership.

This guide’s chapters are in chronological order, representing the broad phases of the process of starting a centre. If you have any questions, need any more help, or just want to chat about your experiences, please [{{< icon name="envelope" pack="fas" >}} contact me.](https://mitchell.science/#contact).

I’m delighted to acknowledge that neither The Sussex Cancer Research Centre, nor this guide, would exist without the help and support I was given by my co-directors Timothy Humphrey, Melanie Flint, and Duncan Gilbert
