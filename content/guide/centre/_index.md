This guide will provide practical advice on launching and leading a research centre, with a specific focus on the challenges and opportunities presented to a Future Leaders Fellow. The guide is likely applicable to any researcher on a rapid trajectory towards leadership, but FLFs are likely to encounter these challenges earlier, and across disciplines in a way that can present unique challenges.

### About the author
It is written from the perspective of an FLF. I recently launched a research centre, in the third year of my Future Leaders Fellowship. By most metrics [this](http://www.SussexCancer.org/launch), [went]( https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/24445605.new-sussex-cancer-research-centre-opens-county/), [well]( https://thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/technology-innovation/sussex-cancer-research-centre-launches-to-connect-regions-top-experts/). **But**, I encountered many challenges on the way, many of which were specific to being an FLF attempting to launch a centre. My rapid career timeline, my interdisciplinary research knowledge (and the knowledge gaps that come along with that), all contributed to challenges I needed to overcome. **Therefore**, I wrote this guide to hopefully ease the journey for others.

I would love to help as many FLFs as possible start research centres.
