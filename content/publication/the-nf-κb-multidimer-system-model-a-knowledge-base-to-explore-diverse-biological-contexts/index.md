abstract: The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) system is critical for various
  biological functions in numerous cell types, including the inflammatory
  response, cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and pathogenic
  responses. Each cell type is characterized by a subset of 15 NF-κB dimers
  whose activity is regulated in a stimulus-responsive manner. Numerous studies
  have produced different mathematical models that account for cell
  type–specific NF-κB activities. However, whereas the concentrations or
  abundances of NF-κB subunits may differ between cell types, the biochemical
  interactions that constitute the NF-κB signaling system do not. Here, we
  synthesized a consensus mathematical model of the NF-κB multidimer system,
  which could account for the cell type–specific repertoires of NF-κB dimers and
  their cell type–specific activation and cross-talk. Our review demonstrates
  that these distinct cell type–specific properties of NF-κB signaling can be
  explained largely as emergent effects of the cell type–specific expression of
  NF-κB monomers. The consensus systems model represents a knowledge base that
  may be used to gain insights into the control and function of NF-κB in diverse
  physiological and pathological scenarios and that describes a path for
  generating similar regulatory knowledge bases for other pleiotropic signaling
  systems.

We used a computational model of NF-kB as a knowledge base, to review how a highly conserved system can do very different things in different contexts.
Different cell types have different NF-kB states and responses to stimuli... why? 
- The interactions are the same,
- The fundamental kinetic rates are probably the same,
- But epigenetics will lead to different expression rates and therefore abundances of NF-kB monomers.

Is cell-type specific expression of NF-kB monomers enough to explain the vast and varied data out there?

We used a model to figure this out.

We incorporated cell type-specific gene expression data into the model and review the literature, comparing virtual cells to what is known.
We reviewed the literature on NF-kB and its response to canonical and non-canonical activating stimuli in different cell types. 

We found that a single conserved signalling network can capture this behavior, by adjusting only cell type–specific expression of NF-κB monomers.
Finally, we turned to cancer, and mutations that occur in cancers including B cell lymphomas. We found that the single conserved model can also capture what is known about how mutations derail the system. We just needed to adjust the parameter affected by the mutation.
