abstract: Brain organoids represent a powerful tool for studying human neurological
  diseases, particularly those that affect brain growth and structure. However, many
  diseases manifest with clear evidence of physiological and network abnormality in
  the absence of anatomical changes, raising the question of whether organoids possess
  sufficient neural network complexity to model these conditions. Here, we explore
  the network-level functions of brain organoids using calcium sensor imaging and
  extracellular recording approaches that together reveal the existence of complex
  network dynamics reminiscent of intact brain preparations. We demonstrate highly
  abnormal and epileptiform-like activity in organoids derived from induced pluripotent
  stem cells from individuals with Rett syndrome, accompanied by transcriptomic differences
  revealed by single-cell analyses. We also rescue key physiological activities with
  an unconventional neuroregulatory drug, pifithrin-$Î±$. Together, these findings
  provide an essential foundation for the utilization of brain organoids to study
  intact and disordered human brain network formation and illustrate their utility
  in therapeutic discovery.
