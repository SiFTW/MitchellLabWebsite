abstract: Decades of research into the molecular signalling determinants of B
  cell fates, and recent progress in characterising the genetic drivers of
  lymphoma, has led to a detailed understanding of B cell malignancies but also
  revealed daunting heterogeneity. While current therapies for diffuse large
  B-cell lymphoma are effective for some patients, they are largely agnostic to
  the biology of each individual’s disease, and approximately one third of
  patients experience relapsed/refractory disease. Consequently, the challenge
  is to understand how each patient’s mutational burden and tumour
  microenvironment combine to determine their response to treatment; overcoming
  this challenge will improve outcomes in lymphoma. This mini review highlights
  how data-driven modelling, statistical approaches and machine learning are
  being used to unravel the heterogeneity of lymphoma. We review how mechanistic
  computational models provide a framework to embed patient data within
  knowledge of signalling. Focusing on recurrently dysregulated signalling
  networks in lymphoma (including NF-κB, apoptosis and the cell cycle), we
  discuss the application of state-of-the-art mechanistic models to lymphoma. We
  review recent advances in which computational models have demonstrated the
  power to predict prognosis, identify promising combination therapies and
  develop digital twins that can recapitulate clinical trial results. With the
  future of treatment for lymphoma poised to transition from one-size-fits-all
  towards personalised therapies, computational models are well-placed to
  identify the right treatments to the right patients, improving outcomes for
  all lymphoma patients.
