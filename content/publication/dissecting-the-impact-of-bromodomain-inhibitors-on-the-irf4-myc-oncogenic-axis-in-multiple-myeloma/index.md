abstract: B-cell progenitor fate determinant interferon regulatory factor 4
  (IRF4) exerts key roles in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple
  myeloma (MM), a currently incurable plasma cell malignancy. Aberrant
  expression of IRF4 and the establishment of a positive auto-regulatory loop
  with oncogene MYC, drives a MM specific gene-expression programme leading to
  the abnormal expansion of malignant immature plasma cells. Targeting the
  IRF4-MYC oncogenic loop has the potential to provide a selective and effective
  therapy for MM. Here we evaluate the use of bromodomain inhibitors to target
  the IRF4-MYC axis through combined inhibition of their known epigenetic
  regulators, BRD4 and CBP/EP300. Although all inhibitors induced cell death, we
  found no synergistic effect of targeting both of these regulators on the
  viability of MM cell-lines. Importantly, for all inhibitors over a time period
  up to 72 hours, we detected reduced IRF4 mRNA, but a limited decrease in IRF4
  protein expression or mRNA levels of downstream target genes. This indicates
  that inhibitor-induced loss of cell viability is not mediated through reduced
  IRF4 protein expression, as previously proposed. Further analysis revealed a
  long half-life of IRF4 protein in MM cells. In support of our experimental
  observations, gene network modelling of MM suggests that bromodomain
  inhibition is exerted primarily through MYC and not IRF4. These findings
  suggest that despite the autofeedback positive regulatory loop between IRF4
  and MYC, bromodomain inhibitors are not effective at targeting IRF4 in MM and
  that novel therapeutic strategies should focus on the direct inhibition or
  degradation of IRF4.
