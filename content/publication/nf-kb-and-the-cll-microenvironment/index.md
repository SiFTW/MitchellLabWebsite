abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent type of
  leukemia in the western world. Despite the positive clinical effects of new
  targeted therapies, CLL still remains an incurable and refractory disease and
  resistance to treatments are commonly encountered. The Nuclear Factor-Kappa B
  (NF-κB) transcription factor has been implicated in the pathology of CLL, with
  high levels of NF-κB associated with disease progression and drug resistance.
  This aberrant NF-κB activation can be caused by genetic mutations in the tumor
  cells and microenvironmental factors, which promote NF-κB signaling.
  Activation can be induced via two distinct pathways, the canonical and
  non-canonical pathway, which result in tumor cell proliferation, survival and
  drug resistance. Therefore, understanding how the CLL microenvironment drives
  NF-κB activation is important for deciphering how CLL cells evade treatment
  and may aid the development of novel targeting therapeutics. The CLL
  microenvironment is comprised of various cells, including nurse like cells,
  mesenchymal stromal cells, follicular dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells. By
  activating different receptors, including the B cell receptor and CD40, these
  cells cause overactivity of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways.
  Within this review, we will explore the different components of the CLL
  microenvironment that drive the NF-κB pathway, investigating how this
  knowledge is being translated in the development of new therapeutics.
