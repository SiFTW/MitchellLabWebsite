abstract: "Background/Objectives: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive
  neoplasm. Although most patients respond to induction therapy, they commonly
  relapse due to recurrent disease in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME).
  So, the disruption of the BMME, releasing tumor cells into the peripheral
  circulation, has therapeutic potential. Methods: Using both primary donor AML
  cells and cell lines, we developed an in vitro co-culture model of the AML
  BMME. We used this model to identify the most effective agent(s) to block AML
  cell adherence and reverse adhesion-mediated treatment resistance. Results: We
  identified that anti-CD44 treatment significantly increased the efficacy of
  cytarabine. However, some AML cells remained adhered, and transcriptional
  analysis identified focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling as a contributing
  factor; the adhered cells showed elevated FAK phosphorylation that was reduced
  by the FAK inhibitor, defactinib. Importantly, we demonstrated that anti-CD44
  and defactinib were highly synergistic at diminishing the adhesion of the most
  primitive CD34high AML cells in primary autologous co-cultures. Conclusions:
  Taken together, we identified anti-CD44 and defactinib as a promising
  therapeutic combination to release AML cells from the chemoprotective AML
  BMME. As anti-CD44 is already available as a recombinant humanized monoclonal
  antibody, the combination of this agent with defactinib could be rapidly
  tested in AML clinical trials."
