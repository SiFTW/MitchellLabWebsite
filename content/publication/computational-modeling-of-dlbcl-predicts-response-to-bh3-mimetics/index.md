abstract: In healthy cells, pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family and BH3-only
  proteins are expressed in a delicate equilibrium. In contrast, this
  homeostasis is frequently perturbed in cancer cells due to the overexpression
  of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins. Variability in the expression and
  sequestration of these proteins in Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
  likely contributes to variability in response to BH3-mimetics. Successful
  deployment of BH3-mimetics in DLBCL requires reliable predictions of which
  lymphoma cells will respond. Here we show that a computational systems biology
  approach enables accurate prediction of the sensitivity of DLBCL cells to
  BH3-mimetics. We found that fractional killing of DLBCL, can be explained by
  cell-to-cell variability in the molecular abundances of signaling proteins.
  Importantly, by combining protein interaction data with a knowledge of genetic
  lesions in DLBCL cells, our in silico models accurately predict in vitro
  response to BH3-mimetics. Furthermore, through virtual DLBCL cells we predict
  synergistic combinations of BH3-mimetics, which we then experimentally
  validated. These results show that computational systems biology models of
  apoptotic signaling, when constrained by experimental data, can facilitate the
  rational assignment of efficacious targeted inhibitors in B cell malignancies,
  paving the way for development of more personalized approaches to treatment.
