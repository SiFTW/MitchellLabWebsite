  Combining mathematical modeling with experiments enables quantitative
  understanding of cell signaling,

  transcriptional regulation, and cell fate decisions. Here, we provide a systems biology approach to link signal

  transduction with B cells fate decisions, to enable quantitative prediction of B-cell proliferation, and

  differentiation. We describe methodology to run simulations that reveal how signal transduction regulates

  gene expression and predicts cell fate decision. We describe how to quantitively validate modeling predic-

  tions with wet-lab experiments.
