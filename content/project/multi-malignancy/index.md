This work is funded by a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship Renewal and aims to extend our impact beyond Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma to related malignancies such as Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma, and even breast cancer with the support of a BSMS20 studentship supporting [Isabelle Jupp](../authors/isabelle/).
