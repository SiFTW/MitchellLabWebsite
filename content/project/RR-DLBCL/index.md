This project is [funded by A UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship](https://www.bsms.ac.uk/about/news/2020/10-15-bsms-researcher-receives-prestigious-fellowship.aspx). We aim to simulate the emergence of relapsed refractory disease during treatment and find therapeutic targets to tackle and prevent refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (RR-DLBCL). This project includes testing computational predictions in the lab.
