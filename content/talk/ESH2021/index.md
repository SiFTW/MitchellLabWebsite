The Mitchell group are participating the European School of Haematology 6th Translational Researh Conference on Lymphoid Malignancies (ESH Lymphoid 2021) (Oct 14-17 2021). A number of our members presenting research updates.
 
[You can view their pre-recorded posters and talks here.](https://lymphoid-2021.esh.live/scientific-programme/). We look forward to interacting with many of you!

[Ielyaas Cloete](../../author/ielyaas-cloete/) is presenting his progress in simulating apoptotic signaling networks to enable better understanding their role in B-Cell lymphoma. Ielyaas's work is [funded by Lekuaemia UK](project/primary-dlbcl/). 

[Arran Pack](../../author/arran-pack/) is presenting his recent work incorporating receptor-proximal signalling mutations frequntly found in DLBCL into models of B-cell receptor signaling and TLR signalling.

[Eleanor Jayawant](../../author/eleanor-jayawant/) is presenting her latest work characterising nuclear factor kappa B difference between B-cell lymphoma cells. Eleanor's work is [funded by a UKRI FLF](project/rr-dlbcl/).
