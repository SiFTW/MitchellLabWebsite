The Mitchell group are participating the European School of Haematology's 6th Translational Research Conference on Lymphoid Malignancies (ESH Lymphoid 2021) (Oct 14-17 2021). A number of our members presenting research updates, which are available to view now!
 
[You can view their pre-recorded posters and talks here.](https://lymphoid-2021.esh.live/scientific-programme/) 

[Ielyaas Cloete](../../author/ielyaas-cloete/) is presenting his progress in simulating the BCL2 family apoptotic signalling network to enable us to better understand its role in B-Cell lymphoma. Ielyaas's work is [funded by Lekuaemia UK](project/primary-dlbcl/). 

[Arran Pack](../../author/arran-pack/) is presenting his recent work incorporating receptor-proximal mutations frequntly found in DLBCL into models of B-cell receptor signalling and TLR signalling.

[Eleanor Jayawant](../../author/eleanor-jayawant/) is presenting her latest work, using a novel flow cytommetry pipeline she has developed, to characterise NF-ÎºB differences between B-cell lymphoma cells. Eleanor's work is [funded by a UKRI FLF](project/rr-dlbcl/).
